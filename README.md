# Data-RISK_MODEL_FOR_STUDENT_PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION_IN_ENGINEERING_COURSES
To use this code one must have a .txt document that contains the data to build fragility curves. The annexed 'logNormal_Score3.0_Statics.txt' is a case of study to create these curves. This file is the result of collecting and organizing data as is described in the paper 'Risk Model for Student Performance Prediction in Engineering Courses'

The file 'Code.m' read the .txt file, then calculate the lognormal distribution parameters to then graph the fragility curves.
