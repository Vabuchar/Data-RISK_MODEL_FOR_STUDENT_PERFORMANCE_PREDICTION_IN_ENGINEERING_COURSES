# Data-RISK_MODEL_FOR_STUDENT_PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION_IN_ENGINEERING_COURSES
This code loads a .txt document with course grade and GPA data to build fragility curves. Refer to 'logNormal_Score3.0_Statics.txt' for an example of the data organization within the .txt file. This file is the result of collecting and organizing data as is described in the paper 'Risk Model for Student Performance Prediction in Engineering Courses'.

The file 'Code.m' reads the .txt file located in the same folder, then calculate the lognormal distribution parameters to then graph the fragility curves.
